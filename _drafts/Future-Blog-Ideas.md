## A list of ideas for future blog posts.
I'm thinking that I would blog about mostly PCG and some other video game related stuff and later on begin putting it all together to build an actual rogue like game.

1. Markov Chains
2. Perlin/Simplex Noise
3. Random Numbers - random tables
4. Seeds
    1. http://blog.runevision.com/2015/01/primer-on-repeatable-random-numbers.html
5. Monster Generator - Flip Book Style
6. Dungeon Generator - This could be a bunch of posts on it's own since there are lots of different strategies and algos.
7. Happy Little Trees - Procedurally Generated Forrest
8. Procedurally Generated Fantasy Names with Markov Chains
9. Decision trees - I'm not sure about this, I think they are cool but maybe they aren't so much PCG. I could blog about AI too I suppose.
10. Basic AI - I guess I will blog about AI. This could be a series going from very rudimentary to complex AI.
11. Free tools and resources for making video games. Again this could be made into a series of blog posts. I could talk about each thing as a separate post or group them into categories.
12. Random facial hair generator.
