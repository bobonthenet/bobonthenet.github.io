I'm trying out something new here. If this works out it will replace my old wordpress blog. I seldom updated that blog and it didn't really have a specific purpose. This new blog will be mostly about making games and some other programming stuff. It will have tutorials, and I'll discuss some of my experiments with demos. It should be cool if I can keep it up. If not I'll discontinue this. If I am able to keep this going I'll take down my old blog and replace that completely with this. For now I'll keep both blogs and we'll see.
